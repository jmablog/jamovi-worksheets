title: 'Jamovi Worksheets'
---

These are a set of worksheets originally written for teaching statistics with Jamovi for undergraduate students. An attempt has been made to update them for general use, but they may still contain traces of university specific guidance. They cover practical instruction for using Jamovi to perform common statistical tests, but don't explain a lot of statistical theory as they go - for that, it's suggested to check out [Learning Statistics with Jamovi](https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/) by Navarro and Foxcroft.
